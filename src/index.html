  <h3 class="aboutTitle">A LITTLE ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="aboutPara container">Throughout my career, I have held several positions that allow me to design innovative e-learning courses and learning materials for companies. It has been my pleasure to be a part of teams that have allowed me to problem solve and express myself creatively. When I came across Nashville Software School, I knew that I had a chance to enhance my skill set in order to myself a better designer. From that point I knew that I had to challenge myself to learn how to build aesthetically beautiful and riveting websites. </p>
